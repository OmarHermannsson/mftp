# mftp

**High-throughput file transfer over high-latency links.**

mftp is built for the scenarios where `scp` crawls: satellite uplinks, intercontinental hops, anything where bandwidth × delay product is large. It multiplexes a single file across parallel QUIC streams, adapts chunk size and stream count to measured RTT, and compresses on the fly — while keeping the UX as simple as `scp`.

```
mftp send dataset.tar.gz user@remote-host:/data/
```

That's it. No receiver daemon to start first, no firewall rules to configure.

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| **QUIC transport** | Parallel streams over a single connection; no TCP head-of-line blocking |
| **Auto TCP+TLS fallback** | If UDP is blocked, retries transparently over TCP+TLS |
| **SSH-assisted launch** | Spawns the receiver on the remote via SSH — no manual setup |
| **SSH tunnel fallback** | If the transfer port is firewalled, reroutes through the SSH connection |
| **Adaptive compression** | Per-chunk zstd; skips chunks that don't compress (already-compressed formats auto-detected) |
| **End-to-end integrity** | SHA-256 per chunk (wire payload) + full-file hash verified on arrival |
| **RTT-aware negotiation** | Stream count and chunk size auto-tuned from measured round-trip time |
| **Resumable transfers** | Crash-safe bit-vector tracks received chunks; transfers continue where they left off |
| **TOFU authentication** | Self-signed certs with certificate pinning; `--trust` for scripted use |

## Quick start

### Install

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/you/mftp
```

Or build from source:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/you/mftp
cd mftp
cargo build --release
# binary is at target/release/mftp
```

### Send a file (SSH mode — no receiver setup needed)

```sh
# mftp SSHes to the remote, starts the receiver, transfers, and cleans up
mftp send bigfile.tar.gz user@remote-host:/data/landing/
```

mftp connects via your existing SSH credentials. The receiver is started automatically and exits when the transfer completes.

### Send a file (manual receiver)

On the receiver:
```sh
mftp receive --output-dir /data/landing
# Prints: Listening on 0.0.0.0:7777
# Prints: Certificate fingerprint: a3f9...
```

On the sender:
```sh
mftp send bigfile.tar.gz remote-host:7777 --trust a3f9...
```

## Usage

### `mftp send`

```
mftp send [OPTIONS] <FILE> <DESTINATION>
```

`DESTINATION` is either:
- `host:port` — connect to an already-running `mftp receive`
- `[user@]host:/remote/path` — launch the receiver via SSH (recommended)

```
Options:
  --trust <FINGERPRINT>    Pin the receiver's SHA-256 certificate fingerprint.
                           Omit to use TOFU (fingerprint printed on first connect).
                           Ignored in SSH mode — fingerprint is read from the server.
  --remote-mftp <PATH>     Path to mftp on the remote host, if not in PATH.
  -n, --streams <N>        Parallel streams (default: auto from RTT + CPU count).
      --chunk-size <BYTES> Chunk size in bytes (default: auto from RTT).
      --no-compress        Disable adaptive zstd compression.
      --tcp                Force TCP+TLS; skip the QUIC attempt.
  -v, --verbose            Increase log verbosity (-v / -vv / -vvv).
```

### `mftp receive`

```
mftp receive [OPTIONS] [BIND]
```

`BIND` defaults to `0.0.0.0:7777`. Both QUIC (UDP) and TCP+TLS listen on the same port, so the sender's auto-fallback works with no extra configuration on the receiver side.

```
Options:
  -o, --output-dir <DIR>   Directory to write received files into (default: .).
      --tcp                TCP+TLS only; don't open a QUIC endpoint.
```

### `mftp --version`

```
mftp 0.1.0
```

---

## How it works

### Transport

mftp defaults to QUIC (via [quinn](https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn)) and falls back to TCP+TLS automatically:

```
Sender                                    Receiver
  │                                           │
  ├─── QUIC connect (5 s timeout) ──────────►│
  │    (if UDP is blocked or times out)       │
  ├─── TCP+TLS connect ─────────────────────►│
  │    (if TCP port also unreachable)         │
  └─── SSH -L tunnel → TCP+TLS ────────────►│
```

Both transports use TLS 1.3 with a freshly generated self-signed certificate. QUIC and TCP+TLS share the same certificate (and therefore the same fingerprint), so the receiver only needs to advertise one.

### SSH-assisted launch

When you write `mftp send file.bin user@host:/path`, the sender:

1. SSHes to `user@host` and runs `mftp server --output-dir /path`
2. The remote server binds on a random port and prints one JSON line to stdout:
   ```json
   {"port":54321,"fingerprint":"a3f9..."}
   ```
3. The sender reads the handshake, then attempts a direct connection to `host:54321`
4. If the direct connection fails (firewall blocks the port), the sender opens an SSH `-L` port-forward and retries over loopback — transparently, without user interaction

The remote `mftp server` exits as soon as the transfer completes.

### Parallel streams and RTT negotiation

After the QUIC handshake, sender and receiver exchange CPU core counts. The sender then reads the measured RTT from the QUIC connection stats and computes:

| RTT | Default chunk size |
|-----|-------------------|
| < 10 ms (LAN) | 8 MiB |
| 10 – 50 ms (regional) | 4 MiB |
| 50 – 150 ms (intercontinental) | 2 MiB |
| ≥ 150 ms (satellite) | 1 MiB |

Stream count is `max(⌈RTT_ms / 5⌉, min_cores)`, capped at `2 × min(sender_cores, receiver_cores)`. On a satellite link with 600 ms RTT and an 8-core machine on each end, mftp opens 8 streams of 1 MiB chunks — keeping the pipe full while staying within CPU budget.

Both values can be overridden with `--streams` and `--chunk-size`.

### Data flow

```
File on disk
  └─► ChunkQueue (atomic work-stealing index)
        └─► N parallel tasks, one per QUIC/TCP stream:
              ├─ read chunk from file (pread)
              ├─ detect already-compressed format (magic bytes)
              ├─ zstd compress if ≥5% gain
              ├─ SHA-256 hash of wire payload
              └─ send ChunkData frame

Control stream (after all data streams finish):
  Sender ──► SenderMessage::Complete { file_hash }
  Receiver ──► ReceiverMessage::Complete { file_hash }  (after full-file verify)
```

The receiver writes each chunk directly to its final offset with `pwrite`, so no reassembly pass is needed after the transfer.

### Wire protocol

All messages are length-prefixed bincode frames (`[u32 LE length][payload]`):

```
Control stream (1 per connection):
  Sender → NegotiateRequest   { cpu_cores, file_size }
  Receiver → NegotiateResponse { cpu_cores }
  Sender → TransferManifest   { transfer_id, file_name, file_size, chunk_size,
                                 total_chunks, num_streams, compression, fec }
  Receiver → ReceiverMessage::Ready { have_chunks }   ← resume list
  ...data streams transfer...
  Sender → SenderMessage::Complete  { file_hash }
  Receiver → ReceiverMessage::Complete { file_hash }

Data streams (N per connection, one ChunkData per chunk):
  Sender → ChunkData { transfer_id, chunk_index, chunk_hash, compressed, payload }
```

### Compression

mftp compresses each chunk independently, so the decision can be made chunk-by-chunk:

1. **Magic-byte check** — if the first 4 bytes match a known compressed format (gzip, zstd, bzip2, zip, 7-zip, xz, jpeg, png, mp4, mkv/webm…), compression is skipped entirely.
2. **Sample probe** — the first 4 KiB of the chunk is compressed with zstd to estimate the ratio.
3. **Threshold** — if the estimated compressed size is not at least 5% smaller, the chunk is sent raw.
4. **Per-chunk flag** — `ChunkData.compressed` tells the receiver whether to decompress.

This means a tarball of mixed content (source code + pre-built binaries) will compress the text files and pass the binaries through unmodified, all in one transfer.

### Integrity

- **Per-chunk**: SHA-256 of the wire payload (post-compression). The receiver rejects any chunk whose hash doesn't match before writing it to disk.
- **Full-file**: SHA-256 of the original file bytes, computed by the sender. After all chunks are written and decompressed, the receiver computes the same hash from its received data and compares. A mismatch fails the transfer.

### Resume

Each transfer has a UUID that the sender embeds in every `ChunkData` frame. On the receiver side, a bit-vector tracking which chunks have been received is flushed to `<output_dir>/<transfer_id>.mftp-resume` after each chunk. If the transfer is interrupted:

1. Restart `mftp receive` (or re-run the same `mftp send` command in SSH mode)
2. The receiver finds the resume file, reads which chunks it already has
3. In the `ReceiverMessage::Ready` response it lists those chunks
4. The sender skips them and only retransmits what's missing

The resume file is deleted on successful completion.

### Security

mftp uses self-signed TLS certificates with a TOFU (Trust On First Use) model, similar to SSH:

- The receiver generates a fresh key pair on every start
- It prints the SHA-256 fingerprint of its certificate
- The sender prints the peer fingerprint and prompts for confirmation on first connect
- Pass `--trust <fingerprint>` to skip the prompt in scripts or CI

For SSH-assisted transfers the fingerprint is obtained automatically over the existing SSH channel — no manual verification step required.

Socket buffers are set to 32 MiB (`SO_SNDBUF` / `SO_RCVBUF`) on both ends. This covers the bandwidth-delay product at 1 Gbps × 250 ms RTT.

## Performance tips

- **Satellite / high-latency links**: mftp is designed for these. Let RTT negotiation pick the parameters; don't override unless you have a reason.
- **LAN transfers**: QUIC over loopback has measurable overhead vs. plain TCP. Use `--tcp` for same-datacenter or LAN transfers.
- **Pre-compressed data** (videos, archives, already-zstd files): mftp auto-detects these and skips the compression probe. No `--no-compress` needed.
- **OS socket buffer limit**: On Linux, the kernel may cap socket buffers below 32 MiB. Set `net.core.rmem_max` and `net.core.wmem_max` to `33554432` on both hosts for maximum throughput.

  ```sh
  sudo sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=33554432 net.core.wmem_max=33554432
  ```

## Building

```sh
cargo build --release
```

Requires Rust 1.75+ (for `div_ceil` stabilization).

```sh
# Check only (fast)
cargo check

# Tests
cargo test

# Lint
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

---

## Roadmap

- **Reed-Solomon FEC** — parity shards for lossy links (e.g. satellite with burst loss); framework is in place
- **Directory transfer** — recursive send with a single command
- **Progress over SSH** — rich progress reporting in SSH mode (currently handled by the sender side only)
- **Windows support** — currently Linux/macOS only
